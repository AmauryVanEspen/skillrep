This project was inspired by the very interesting <a href=http://stackrating.com/>StackRating</a> but the approach here is different.
<br>It 's mostly a filtering of the SO reputation to keep the gain that can most be related to some developer skill and reduce the noise added by highly popular questions:
<ul>
	<li>  Question score is ignored
	<li>  <s>Only accepted answers are counted</s> (might change, discussion welcome)
	<li>  Self-answered questions are ignored
	<li>  Closed questions are ignored
	<li>  Score (upvotes minus downvotes) per answer is capped at 10
	<li>  Skill Rep per answer is 10*score plus 15 when accepted
	<li>  There's no daily reputation cap
	<li>  Bounties are ignored
	<li>  Votes coming more than one week after the question creation may be ignored
</ul>
<p>
In the future I might also ponder the value of the votes (currently 10) using the skill rep the asker won (questions asked by good answerers seem to be better overall).
</p>
<p>
I would also have loved to ponder using the skill rep of the voters but the API keeps this data secret.

The companion for the SkillRep web site is the <a href=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skillrep/mgacjhnogpfhjfdkbdpckjnlclgenblp>SkillRep Chrome extension</a>.
<br>It displays the rank and rep of every user next to his name.
